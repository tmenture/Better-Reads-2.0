## Description:
* BetterReads 2.0 is your very own digital bookshelf. Users can search any title or author, and be presented with many options to choose from. If a user wants more they can make an account to save books that interest them to their read list, and can make donations if they really enjoy the website.
* Description: Your personal digital bookshelf. This application allows you to search books by title or author and if one peaks your interest you can save it to your list for later. 
* Motivation: To help users remember those little things, in this case specifically, one or multiple books they have been thinking about reading. Now they have a place to keep them and check when they forget.
* User Story: As a busy reader, I want to be able to search a book, and save it so that I may look into it when I have the time.
